# Google OAuth Test App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Then it was stripped down to the basics. I wasn't sure what I was going to do with this project initially. Basically I copied the code from Google's OAuth documentation and got it working with my API credentials. Which I then stripped out before committing the code.
